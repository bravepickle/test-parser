# test-parser
This is a test assignment for parsing data

## Task
1. Make fork from GitHub repository
1. Using this new fork do the following:
    1. Write command that can parse CSV file via site URL that can be found in the same repository - `public/parse me.csv` and save to MySQL DB
    1. Performance optimizations for possible big files
    1. Save parsed rows data to table `products`
    1. Command summary results must be saved to separate DB table - `parsing_result`
    1. The following rules must be followed
        * all valid data must be saved
        * errors handling
        * already existing data in DB must be refreshed and new - added
        * this data should be easy to use for following processing
    1. It is possible to add and modify this fork code contents to your liking if needed for some reason
1. Write instructions on how to run your command and notes if needed how to configure it so that it was possible to run it locally
1. Make GitHub pull request
1. Provide address to your GitHub repo fork
1. Wait for feedback :). Good luck!
